Project Title: Wildlife Strikes Analysis (2000â€“2015)
Tool Used: Tableau
Project Type: Analytical Dashboard

Summary:
Developed a comprehensive Tableau dashboard analyzing wildlife strikes at U.S. airports between 2000 and 2015. The project visualizes critical aspects such as:

Top 25 airports by strike cost using a horizontal bar graph

Wildlife species group with most strikes via vertical bar graph

Animal category trends over time using a line chart

Impact by aircraft type through side-by-side bars

Geographic distribution of strikes across U.S. states using a map

Species-specific strike orders displayed via a tree map

Flight phases affected shown through circular and pie charts

Day/time and phase-wise analysis via dot plots and box-whisker charts

Forecasting future strike trends using time series data

Damage cost analysis with bullet charts

Custom bin visualization for flight phases over time.

The dashboard helps aviation authorities and analysts identify patterns, assess risks, and implement data-driven safety measures.
